# Python GUI
This project is a Python-based GUI application designed to perform basic mathematical operations for calculating the factorial of a number and finding its square root. The interface is built using the BreezyPythonGui library, making it easy to use and navigate.

## Interface Description
* Input Field: A single input field where users can enter a number.
* Buttons: Two buttonsâ€”one to calculate the factorial and another to calculate the square root.
* Output Field: An output area where the result of the calculation is displayed.
## Technologies Used
* Python: The programming language used for developing the application.
* BreezyPythonGui: A lightweight GUI framework utilized to create the user interface.
